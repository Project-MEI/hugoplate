Project MEI began as a Discord bot I created for the Honkai Impact armada server, Teriri Gaming Hub (TGH). Originally named Shogun, the bot was designed to assist with armada management and provide tailored moderation tools for the server. Although I eventually moved on from TGH, my passion for the project continued. Over time, it evolved into a personal homelab environment where I explore self-hosting, automation, and hands-on learning.

Today, I work remotely as a fullstack developer, but I still carve out time for my hobbiesâ€”especially gaming, tech and anime. Project MEI remains a reflection of my passion for building, learning, and having fun with the things I enjoy.
