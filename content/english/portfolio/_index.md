#### Some Q&A

{{< accordion "Do you take commissions? Can you make something for me?" >}}
Generally no. From time to time I may make a special exception for friends or family but these days work, loved ones and personal hobbies already occupy enough of my time. If you have an idea, feel free to tell me but I probably won't make it happen.

{{< accordion "Your work is so crappy/amazing!" >}}
Yeah, I know. Sorry about that/thank you for the compliment.

{{< accordion "Why isn't there a lot of things here?" >}}
I'm not great at documenting stuff. Most things are either forgotten forever or live in my memory to cherish for a while.
