**Project MEI** started as a Discord bot I created for the Honkai Impact armada server, **Teriri Gaming Hub** (TGH). Originally named **Shogun**, the bot was designed to assist with armada management and provide tailored moderation tools for the server. Although I eventually left TGH due to personal reasons, I decided to keep running the bot to continue assisting the server in my absence.

Over the years, more and more features were added as **Shogun** ended up being a semi public bot that can be invited by anyone. To save on hosting cost on cloud VPS, a few years down the road I eventually decided to use my own hardware for hosting and led me down a journey on running my own home server. Today, that home server project is known as **Sirin**.

As for my own story, I'm just a regular person on the internet with a passion for tech, anime and gaming. I took a diploma in Computer Science, and currently work full time as a fullstack developer. My main tech stack now is PHP using CodeIgniter framework.
